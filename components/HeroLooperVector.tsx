/**
 * The "Looper BG" decorative vector behind the hero, reproduced from its
 * exported SVG asset (already gold/white-gradient toned in the source file
 * — see public/brand/looper-bg.svg). Per request: this specific vector
 * glows gold as the cursor moves near/along it. The general sitewide
 * cursor-glow has been turned off — this replaces it, scoped to just this
 * graphic.
 *
 * Implementation: the same image is layered twice — a dim resting copy,
 * and a brightened+glowing copy revealed only within a soft radius around
 * the pointer via a CSS radial-gradient mask. The mask position is written
 * directly to the DOM on pointermove (no React state) to stay smooth.
 * Skipped for touch input and prefers-reduced-motion.
 *
 * The resting copy's own asset (looper-bg.svg) carries near-zero baked-in
 * path opacity — fine against the dark theme's near-black page, where even
 * a faint pale stroke shows up, but against the light theme it was
 * reading as fully invisible: no CSS filter can raise an SVG's own alpha,
 * so it stayed invisible until the boosted-opacity hover layer kicked in
 * ("not visible unless I hover on it"). Light mode's resting copy swaps to
 * that same boosted-opacity asset instead (looper-bg-glow.svg — the one
 * the hover glow already uses), dimmed down with a real opacity + a
 * darkening filter so it reads as quiet background linework rather than
 * the bright lit-up hover state.
 *
 * Dark mode's resting copy gets a mild brightness boost on top of its own
 * baked-in opacity (per request that it read a bit lighter at rest,
 * before the pointer-glow kicks in) — still nowhere near the hover
 * layer's own brightness(2.2)+drop-shadow treatment, just enough for the
 * resting linework to read a little more clearly against the dark page.
