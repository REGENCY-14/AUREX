/**
 * The "grid card" visual beside the About section's heading. Cycles through
 * four center states — the AUREX logo, then the three proof-point stats
 * from Figma nodes 37:2522 / 37:2541 / 37:2555 (same card, different center
 * content: $4.2B+ Global AUM, 60 Verified Members, 14.8% Performance Yield).
 *
 * Auto-advances on a timer while idle, advances immediately on click, and
 * pauses the timer while hovered so it doesn't change mid-interaction. The
 * background layers get a slow continuous breathing animation of their own,
 * independent of which center state is showing.
 *
 * Reduced-motion handling: the autoplay timer is gated on
 * useReducedMotion() inside the effect below (safe — effects only run
 * client-side, after hydration). The motion.* transform animations below
 * are always passed the same props on every render — they are NOT
 * conditionally branched on useReducedMotion() in JSX, because that value
 * resolves differently between the server render and the client's first
 * paint, which caused a real hydration mismatch when tried. Transform-based
 * motion (scale/rotate/x/y) is instead neutralized automatically by the
 * root layout's <MotionConfig reducedMotion="user">, which is the
 * library's own SSR-safe mechanism for this.
