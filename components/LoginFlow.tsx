/**
 * The whole /login experience: which dashboard you land on (Investor vs
 * Business Owner) depends on which role you're logging in as, so that has
 * to be picked before there's a credentials form to show at all — see
 * app/login/page.tsx for how this replaces what used to be a single
 * always-visible LoginForm.
 *
 * `role` starts null (the picker); choosing one reveals that role's form
 * in its place, with a "Choose a different role" link back to the picker
 * rather than a second, separate page — nothing here needs its own route,
 * this is one screen with two phases. The picker phase gets its own
 * "Back to Home" link (the page's own logo up top already links home, but
 * it's icon-only — this is the same escape hatch as an actual visible
 * link, matching "Choose a different role"'s own treatment one step
 * later in the flow).
 *
 * The "AUREX Login" eyebrow that used to sit above "Welcome Back" is
 * gone per request — the outer card, the logo above it (see
 * app/login/page.tsx), and the page's own <title> already say what this
 * screen is, so it was a redundant label rather than new information.
 *
 * Content is grouped into its own bordered sub-section (this header,
 * then — inside LoginForm — the fields and the submit button each get
 * one too) all sharing the same `gap-5` rhythm, so the spacing between
 * every section reads as one consistent system rather than whatever
 * margin each part happened to need before.
