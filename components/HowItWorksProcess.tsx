        {/* Grid-line dividers between cards, matching the Figma layout's
            connecting lines. Built via gap-px + a bg-grid-line backdrop
            (the container's own background shows through the 1px gaps as
            the dividing lines) rather than each card drawing its own
            border — a per-card border, even collapsed onto its neighbor
            with a negative margin, produces two overlapping 1px lines at
            every shared edge, and the DOM-order-dependent paint order
            between them meant a hovered row-2 card's gold top edge could
            end up hidden under row-1's plain gray bottom edge. With the
            gap technique there's only ever one line, owned by the
            container, so there's nothing for a card's own hover outline
            to compete with — outline-offset-0 just draws it flush along
            that same 1px seam on all four sides. */}
