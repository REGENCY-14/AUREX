/**
 * AUREX wordmark/icon. Theme-aware: the dark-mode exports render "AUREX"
 * in white text (invisible once the navbar/footer backgrounds go light in
 * light mode), so light mode swaps to dark-text exports instead.
 *
 * All four files are pre-cropped, purpose-made assets (see the crop
 * script in project history) that isolate just the icon, or icon +
 * "AUREX" text, out of the much larger original square/near-square
 * exports — those also include a tagline underneath that never needs to
 * show at this size, and don't share a common aspect ratio with each
 * other (nor with `boxClassName`'s own fixed ratio, which is one shared
 * shape for both).
 *
 * object-contain, not object-cover: the "AUREX" wordmark runs edge-to-edge
 * in every crop (the A and X sit flush against the image's own left/right
 * border), and every crop is wider than `boxClassName`'s box. object-cover
 * fills the box exactly by scaling to the box's height and cropping
 * whatever overflows the width — which sliced straight through the
 * leading A and trailing X on both sides, a truncated-looking logo.
 * object-contain scales to fit the whole image inside the box instead
 * (leaving a little empty vertical space rather than cropping), so the
 * full wordmark always renders intact.
