 * The tab bar shared by both the Investor Dashboard (/dashboard/*) and
 * the Business Owner Dashboard (/business-dashboard/*) — same four
 * tabs, same component, just a different `basePath` per role. What each
 * tab actually shows differs by role (see each role's own
 * app/(dashboard route)/{tab}/page.tsx — an investor's Investment tab is
 * open slots to back, a business owner's is their listing status/detail;
 * Report is the one tab whose content (components/dashboard/
 * ReportSection.tsx) is already the exact same component for both roles),
 * but the navigation itself is one shared piece rather than two
 * lookalike copies.
 *
 * Same active-link treatment as the main site's own Navbar.tsx desktop
 * links (gold underline + gold-clip-text gradient on the active tab)
 * rather than inventing a new tab-bar style, since this is the same
 * "which of a few top-level destinations am I on" job.
