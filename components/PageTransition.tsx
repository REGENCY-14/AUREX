/**
 * Route-level transition, wrapping every page's rendered output (see
 * app/layout.tsx). Nothing previously animated route changes at all —
 * navigating between pages swapped instantly, unlike every in-page section
 * (which fades/slides in via scrollReveal/staggerContainer).
 *
 * Deliberately NOT wrapped in <AnimatePresence>: an earlier version used
 * `<AnimatePresence mode="wait">` keyed on pathname so the outgoing page
 * could play an exit fade before the next one mounted. That's a
 * well-documented source of exactly one bug — the exit phase getting
 * stuck and leaving a blank page until a manual refresh — with
 * framer-motion + the Next.js App Router, and a real user hit it here
 * (clicking "Exit" on the investor application). It couldn't be
 * reproduced under automation (fast clicks, throttled network, reduced
 * motion, a production build, mid-flow state all came back clean), which
 * means there's no confident fix for the specific trigger — only for the
 * mechanism. So instead of patching around one reproduction of it, this
 * removes the "wait for the old page's exit before mounting the new one"
 * behavior entirely.
 *
 * What's left is an enter-only fade: React swaps the old keyed element for
 * the new one immediately (ordinary unmount, nothing deferred or blocked
 * on an animation callback), and the new page just fades in via
 * `routeTransition`. Less precious than a true crossfade, but it can't get
 * stuck — there's nothing left to hang.
