 * with none of the shell's usual chrome (no progress bar, no Back/
 * Continue: this is an endpoint, not another step to fill out).
 *
 * Always renders status="pending" — there's no real review process yet
 * that could have already reached "approved" or "rejected" the moment
 * someone lands here fresh off their own submission. The other two states
 * exist for the standalone /apply/status route (see
 * ApplicationStatusScreen's own comment), for a returning applicant whose
 * (still-stubbed) application has since been reviewed.
