 * extracted here (shared apply/, not flow-specific) once the Business
 * Owner flow needed the identical preview for its own Nickname step and
 * Review & Submit screen, rather than a lookalike copy that could quietly
 * drift out of sync with the original.
 *
 * `bare` drops this component's own card border/padding/background,
 * keeping only the row itself — for a caller that already sits inside its
 * own bordered container (a Review & Submit step's section card). Without
 * it, that section nested this card's border+padding inside its own,
 * which both looked like a redundant box-in-a-box and ate enough width on
 * narrow screens to truncate names that fit fine in the Nickname step's
 * own single-card context.

          max-w-xl card (doubly so inside Step 5's own nested review

          actual phone, which defeats the entire point of a preview. The
