 * The 6-step Business Owner Application (Applicant & Business -> Nickname

 * Reached from the "List Your Business" option in JoinAurexModal.
 *
 * Lives at /apply-business rather than /apply/business — matching the
 * brief's own standalone-status-route example (/apply-business/status)
 * rather than nesting under the Investor flow's /apply/investor segment,
 * since these are two parallel, independent flows sharing a shell, not one
 * flow with sub-routes.
