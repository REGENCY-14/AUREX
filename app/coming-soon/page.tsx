/**
 * Shared destination for every nav item, footer link, and CTA that
 * doesn't have a real page behind it yet — this build only fleshes out
 * the home page (Hero/About/Packages/Client Perspectives/CTA). Rather
 * than leaving those as dead "#" anchors that silently do nothing, they
 * route here so visiting them gives real feedback instead.
 *
 * Content lives in components/ComingSoonContent.tsx (a client component)
 * so this file can stay a plain Server Component and export `metadata` —
 * same split used by app/not-found.tsx + components/NotFoundContent.tsx.
