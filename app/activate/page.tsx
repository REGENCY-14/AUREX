/**
 * The screen an "your application was approved" email would link to
 * (?token=...) — reached only after Admin approves an Investor or
 * Business Owner application (see components/ApplicationStatusScreen's own
 * "approved" state, which currently sends people to their dashboard
 * directly since this flow didn't exist yet; a real approval action would
 * email this link instead of that). Same minimal chrome as /login,
 * /forgot-password, and /reset-password — logo + centered card, no site
 * Navbar/Footer, since this is a focused, single-purpose screen reached
 * outside any authenticated session.
 *
 * ActivationFlow reads the token via useSearchParams, which Next.js
 * requires a Suspense boundary for on static builds — see
 * ResetPasswordFlow.tsx's own comment for the same reasoning.
