 * Thin wrapper only — the actual shell (header, tabs, auth guard) is a
 * Client Component (components/dashboard/InvestorDashboardShell.tsx)
 * because it needs useAuth/useRequireAuth, and its own DashboardTabs
 * child calls useSearchParams(). Next.js requires that hook to sit
 * inside a <Suspense> boundary for static builds; a layout.tsx can't
 * wrap its own returned JSX in Suspense and have that cover itself, so
 * this file's only job is providing that boundary one level up.
