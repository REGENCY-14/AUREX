/**
 * Standalone landing spot for a returning applicant checking their status
 * later (e.g. a "check my application status" link) — distinct from
 * reaching this same screen as Step 6 right after submitting (see
 * components/apply/investor/ConfirmationStep.tsx, reached only through the
 * Investor Application flow itself).
 *
 * There's no backend/auth yet to look an application up by session or
 * account, so status/nickname/phone are read straight from the URL's own
 * query string as a stub data source — e.g.
 * /apply/status?status=approved&nickname=GoldFalcon — defaulting to a
 * generic "pending" view for a bare /apply/status with no query string at
 * all. Swapping this for a real lookup later means changing this file, not
 * ApplicationStatusScreen itself.
