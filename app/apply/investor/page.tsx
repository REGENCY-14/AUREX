 * Deliberately skips the site's usual Navbar/Footer chrome — this is a
 * focused, low-friction application flow, not a marketing page, so
 * MultiStepFormShell renders its own minimal header (logo + exit link)
 * instead. Steps 3-6 aren't built yet; see
 * components/apply/investor/StepTwoPlaceholder.tsx.
