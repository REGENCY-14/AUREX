/**
 * Country list for "Country of residence" dropdowns. Built from
 * libphonenumber-js's own country registry (already a dependency for
 * phone validation — see components/apply/investor/IdentityContactStep.tsx)
 * paired with Intl.DisplayNames for human-readable names, rather than a
 * hand-maintained ~195-row array.
 *
 * Note: `Intl.supportedValuesOf` cannot be used for this — despite the
 * name, its only valid keys are "calendar" | "collation" | "currency" |
 * "numberingSystem" | "timeZone" | "unit"; it has no "region"/country
 * option, so there's no built-in way to enumerate countries without
 * either a data source like this or a hardcoded list.
